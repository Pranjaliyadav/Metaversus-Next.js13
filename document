app folder - most important u=folder in next.js 13
we exported all components in page.js

constants has all the extracted data that we going to use in design

global.css has all the tailwind styles
index.js - most common used styled extracted

utils have
framer motion motion.js like having special functions for slide in, text variants

head.js lets chnge title of site and favicon
layout.js have special font directly extracted from design

>npm install
>npm run dev

no need to write const serversidebox
in next.js 13 all components inside the app directory are react server compoents by default
including special files and colocated components. this allows us to 
automaticly adopt server components with no extra work and achieve great performance out of the box
this way apps are much faster cacheable predictable in size


but sometimes you wont be able to use it on client side 
like no hooks and all
so to use that just put 'use client' directive at top of file before any imports
and then continue using react hooks whatever way u like

but only use it when u really need to use client side hooks like
useEFfect or useState
otherwise just use server components
